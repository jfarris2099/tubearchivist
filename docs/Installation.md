These are beginners guides installation instructions for additional platforms generously provided by users of these platforms. When in doubt, verify the details with the [Readme](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist#installing-and-updating). If you see any issues here while using these instructions, please contribute. 

## Podman
Podman handles container hostname resolving slightly differently than docker, so you need to make a few changes to the `docker-compose.yml` to get up and running.

### Step 1: Follow the installation instructions from the [README](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist#installing-and-updating), with a few additional changes to the `docker-compose.yml`.

Edit these additional changes to the `docker-compose.yml`:
 - under `tubearchivist`->`image`:
 	- prefix the container name with `docker.io/` (or the url of your repo of choice).
 - under `tubearchivist`->`environment`:
  - `ES_URL`: change `archivist-es` to the internal IP of the computer that will be running the containers.
  - `REDIS_HOST`: change `archivist-redis` to the internal IP of the computer that will be running the containers (should be the same as above).
 - under `archivist-redis`->`image`: 
 	- prefix the container name with `docker.io/` again.
 - under `archivist-redis`->`expose`: 
  - change the whole entry from `expose: ["<PORT>"]` into `ports: ["<PORT>:<PORT>"].
 - under `archivist-es`->`image`: 
 	- prefix the container name with `docker.io/` again.
 - under `archivist-es`->`expose`: 
  - change the whole entry from `expose: ["<PORT>"]` into `ports: ["<PORT>:<PORT>"].

### Step 2: Create service files (optional)

Since podman doesn't run as a service, it can't start containers after reboots, at least not without some help.

If you want to enable this behavior, you can follow [this example](https://techblog.jeppson.org/2020/04/create-podman-services-with-podman-compose/) to have `systemd` start up the containers with `podman-compose` when the computer boots up.


## Unraid

Tube Archivist, and all if it's dependencies are located in the [community applications](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=tubearchivist) store. The three containers you will need are as follows:

-   **TubeArchivist-RedisJSON**: This container acts as a cache and temporary link between the application and the file system. Used to store and display messages and configuration variables.
-   **TubeArchivist-ES**: ElasticSearch stores video metadata and makes everything searchable. Also keeps track of the download queue.
-   **TubeArchivist**: Once your YouTube video collection grows, it becomes hard to search and find a specific video. That's where Tube Archivist comes in: By indexing your video collection with metadata from YouTube, you can organize, search and enjoy your archived YouTube videos without hassle offline through a convenient web interface.

### Step 1: Install  `TubeArchivist-RedisJSON`

![TubeArchivist-RedisJSON](https://i.imgur.com/iGJZKYd.png)
This is the easiest container to setup of the thee, just make sure that you do not have any port conflicts, and that your `/data` is mounted to the correct path. The other containers will map to the same root directory (/mnt/user/appdata/TubeArchivist).

If you need to install `TubeArchivist-RedisJSON`on a different port, you'll have to follow [these steps](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist#redis-on-a-custom-port) later on when installing the `TubeArchivist` container


### Step 2: Install  `TubeArchivist-ES`
![TubeArchivist-ES](https://i.imgur.com/RC38b3u.png)
ElasticSeach is also pretty easy to setup. Again, make sure you have no port conflicts, make sure that you mapped the ElasticSearch Data to the same root directory as `RedisJSON` (/mnt/user/appdata/TubeArchivist), and make sure to change the default password to something more secure. 

There is four additional settings in the "show more settings" area, but don't require any changes.


### Step 3: Install  `TubeArchivist`

![TubeArchivist](https://i.imgur.com/oLsmwBZ.png)
It's finally time to set up TubeArchivist!

 - `HOST:`This is a list of IP addresses that you will host TA from. Example, 192.168.0.14 is the IP address of my Unraid server. If I was going to access TA from a VPN, or domain name, I'd put those next to my host IP with just a space separating the different addresses. More information [here.](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist#installing-and-updating)


 - `Port:`Again, make sure that you have no port conflicts on 8000.
   
 - `Youtube Media Path:` is where you'll download all of your videos to.
   Make sure that this is an empty directory to not cause confusion when
   starting the application. If you have existing videos that you'd like
   to import into Tube Archivist, please checkout the [settings
   wiki.](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist/wiki/Settings#manual-media-files-import)
   
   
- `Appdata:` This should be the same base path as the other two containers (/mnt/user/appdata/TubeArchivist).
   
 - `TA Username:`This will be your username for TubeArchivist.
   
 - `TA Password:`This will be your password for TubeArchivist.
   
 - `Redis` This will be JUST the ip address of your redis container.

 - `ElasticSearch Password:`This is the password you defined in the `TubeArchivist-ES` container.
 - `ElasticSearch:` This seems to cause some confusion, but it's a pretty simple step, just replace the IP and Port to match you `TubeArchivist-ES` container.

 (example: if your IP is 192.168.0.14, the value should be http://192.168.0.14:9200)

 - `Time Zone:` This is an important step for your scheduler, to find your timezone, use a site like [TimeZoneConverter](http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/findzone.tzc) 

### From there, you should be able to start up your containers and you're good to go!

## Synology

There are several different methods to install TubeArchivist on Synology platforms. This will focus on the available `docker` package and `docker-compose` implementations.

### Prepare Directories/Folders
Before we setup TubeArchivist, we need to setup the directories/folders. You are assumed to be logged into the Synology NAS.
#### 1. Docker Base Folder
   1. Open the `File Station` utility.
   2. Click on the **CreateðŸ”½** button and choose *Create New Shared Folder*.
   3. **Name** the folder "Docker".
   4. Add a **Description**.
   5. Select the **Volume Location**. 
      > Note: By default, this will be where all data is stored. Change the folders as best meets your requirements.
   6. Select the appropriate options from the remaining checkbox configurations.
![Synology - Create Docker Folder](assets/Synology_0.2.0_Docker-Folder-Create.png)
   7. Click the **Next** button.
   8. If you are going to **Encrypt** your folder, check the appropriate box and provide the Encryption Key and its confirmation.
   9. Click the **Next** button.
   10. On the **Advanced Settings** page, you can select the *Enable data checksum for advanced data integrity* setting. This may cause a performance impact, but will allow for potential file self-healing. **This cannot be changed later.**
       > Note: This is not recommended, as we will be hosting databases within this folder.
   11. If you are enabling a quota for how large the folder can get, you can select the *Enabled shared folder quota* setting and choose the maximum size this folder can grow. This can be changed later.
   12. Click the **Next** button.
   13. Confirm the settings, then click the **Apply** button. This will create the folder.
#### 2. TubeArchivist Base Folder
   1. Open the `File Station` utility.

   4. Click on the `CreateðŸ”½` button and choose *create Folder*.
   5. **Name** the folder "media".
#### 7. Confirm Folder Structure
Once all of the folders have been created, it should have a folder structure within Docker\TubeArchivist that includes "cache", "es", "media", and "redis" folders.
![Synology - Docker Folder Structure](assets/Synology_0.2.0_Docker-Folder-Structure.png)

#### 8. Change Permissions - CLI Required
> If you do not have SSH access enabled for CLI, [enable it](https://kb.synology.com/en-sg/DSM/tutorial/How_to_login_to_DSM_with_root_permission_via_SSH_Telnet) before continuing.
   1. Open the SSH connection to the Synology. Login as your primary `Admin` user, or the user that was enabled for SSH access.
   2. Elevate your access to `root`. Steps are provided [here](https://kb.synology.com/en-sg/DSM/tutorial/How_to_login_to_DSM_with_root_permission_via_SSH_Telnet).
   3. Change directories to the **Volume** where the "Docker" folder resides.
      </br>Example: `cd /volume1`
   4. Change directories to the "Docker" folder.
      </br>Example: `cd Docker`
   5. Change directories to the "TubeArchivist" folder.
      </br>Example: `cd TubeArchivist`
   6. Change the owner of the "redis" folder. *If correct, this does not have an output.*
      </br>Example: `chown 999:100 redis`
   7. Change the owner of the "es" folder. *If correct, this does not have an output.*
      </br>Example: `chown 1000:1000 es`
   8. Confirm that the folders have the correct permissions.
      </br>Example: `ls -hl`
